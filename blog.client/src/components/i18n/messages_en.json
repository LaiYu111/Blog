  "about.introduction": "Hello, I am Laiyu Pei, born in Guangdong (China) in 2001, and I graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Auckland in New Zealand. I enjoy browsing Zhihu and Bilibili, reading technical articles, and playing games. Besides that, I am interested in development, such as building web applications based on React. Of course, I don't limit myself to a single tech stack; I also have project experience with various front-end and back-end frameworks like Vue3, Express.js, .Net Core, and Django."
